# Hyperledger-FL

This project tries to integrate Hyperledger Fabric, Aries Agents, and Indy. The task is training a federated learning model. In order to acheive that
many different architectures can be used. We have selected an architecture according to the following requirements of the project:


### Amount of Customization
We all know that Indy and Aries are working together very well, and the support of Indy from Aries side is really strong. However, Fabric and Indy are completely two different ledgers that are build for different purposes. To the best of our knowledge, there are just a limited number works that try to integrate Indy and Fabric. Moreover, non of those works have considered a task like Federated Learning which has high communication and computation cost. Our approach is to use these components with least amount of customization. Therefore, we try our best to do not change source code of Hyperledger Aries Agents, Indy, and Fabric.

### Scalability
One of the main challenges of federated Learning is that it is hard to scale (e.g. 1 Million Clients) even by having central server. So, we must make sure to do not make this problem worse by introducing two different ledgers to our setup and removing the central server.


For this project, we are going to use many different tools and libraries. This section describes a few of them and their rule in our setup:


### Von Network (Indy)
Von Network project offers and easy and ready-to-use for initating an Indy network. Moreover, it provides a web interface which is useful for tracing and debugging. We have decided to use this network by having very minor customizations. For example, containers of Von Network use their own network for communication with each other. But we decided to change it to use bridge networking, which is easier for development. Please note that all of our customizations can be reverted as the final project is ready. Here is the link to the Von Network that we use, which is a fork from the original repository. 

### Aries Agents: ACA-Py

Hyperledger aries offers many different agent implementation. We have selected ACA-PY as it satisfy all of our requirements, has extensive amount of documentation, and is under active development.
